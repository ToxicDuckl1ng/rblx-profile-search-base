The raw code of a discord bot that creates directories of roblox accounts and you can check if someone from that is online using that directory
Goal: To detect raids in a roblox game and to raid in game events.
How: It would be done by uploading all known host's profiles to the directory and the bot would check if someone from that directory is online.
Reasoning: If a host is in game, they are likely to be hosting an event or attending one. Therefore, it is worthwhile for the bot to notify you if they are (only after you run the command to check it).
